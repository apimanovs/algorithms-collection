# Algorithms Collection

This repository is a personal collection of algorithms implemented in C#.
Each algorithm resides in its own self-contained project folder and includes
simple inline tests directly in `Program.cs` for ease of debugging and demonstration.

The goal is to:
- Learn and practice algorithm implementations
- Keep code clean, readable, and modular
- Avoid test frameworks for simplicity
- Use the latest C# language features when appropriate

Each algorithm project includes:
- An implementation of the algorithm
- A `Main` method with test examples
- Optional README or notes per algorithm

## Getting Started

To run any algorithm project:

```bash
cd Category/AlgorithmName
(dotnet run)
```
Example:
```bash
cd Searching/BinarySearch
(dotnet run)
```

## Why this structure?
This setup is intended to keep things simple while learning:
- No shared solutions or libraries
- Easy to test each algorithm standalone
- Great for version control and tracking personal progress
